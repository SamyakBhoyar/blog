                <p class="text-muted text-left">In the western area of Nagpur, ancient Futala Lake has existed for 200 years. In the absence of maintenance, the use of this prehistoric lake was limited to cattle washing only. It was therefore decided in 2003 to beautify this lake from NIT funds with equal aid from the state government.
                    Tanga (carriage) at Futala Lake
                    The work was done in two stages. Desilting was done on large scale along with the removal of lotus plants and other waste from the lake. The work included repairing the eastern guard wall of the lake, construction of a pathway with granite stone paving, widening of an 18 m wide road under I.R.D.P., roadside guard wall and landscaping berms, parking and garden bays on the other side of the road, and fixing decorative lamp, benches, attractive dust bins, etc. For watering of plants and landscaping, a sprinkler system was provided. For sufficient lighting with four high masts were fixed in the vicinity of the lake. Two coloured 15 feet (4.6 m) fountains and a white 100 feet fountain were set up in the lake.</p>

The 19th animated feature in the Disney Animated Canon, the film is noted for being along with The Aristocats (1970) the last film project to be approved by Walt Disney himself, as he died in late 1966, before the film was released. (However, Walt did work on a few projects before his death as well, most notably the majority of Disney's animated films that came out in the 1970s.) This is also the first animated feature released after Walt Disney's death. The film was inspired by the stories about the feral child Mowgli from the book of the same name by Rudyard Kipling.<br>
